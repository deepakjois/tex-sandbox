# Caste and the Indian Retail Market

# Abstract

This study aims to shed light on the role played by caste in the functioning of India’s retail economy. It looks at some historical and sociological dimensions of the evolution and structure of India’s markets and demonstrates how, in spite of the apparently modern and secular economic policies of the Indian government, caste hierarchies persist in the retail marketplace, with the traditional trading castes still forming the most wealthy and powerful group. It makes use of business ownership data from the Indian Economic Census, 2005 and sample surveys conducted in two small bazaars, along with several recent economic and sociological studies, to reach conclusions about how the caste system remains a pervasive force in the Indian retail sector. It also considers the role affirmative action can play in the creation of a more equitable and diverse retail market, by looking at the effects of such policies in other countries .

# Introduction

## A Brief Overview of India’s Caste System

### The Origins of Caste

The institution of caste forms the basis India’s social structure. The caste system divides Indian society into thousands of castes and sub-castes, based on birth, which form a "graded hierarchy". Members of these endogamous groups are bound by rules which dictate how they interact with and relate to members of other castes. Within the system, occupations and property rights are hereditary and compulsory. Violation of caste norms invites social and economic ostracism, which acts as a regulatory mechanism and keeps the hierarchy in place. (Thorat)

The caste system has its origins in the fourfold Varna system, first mentioned as a divinely ordained hierarchy in the most ancient of Hindu texts, the Rig Veda, which divides human beings into four categories based on their birth. At the very helm of the order are the Brahmins or priests, followed by the Kshatriyas or warriors, then the Vaishyas who are traders and farmers, and finally the Shudras, the labouring masses who are slaves to the other three. The ‘untouchables' or Dalits do not even find a place within this order, and since their incorporation into the Hindu fold have been considered the lowest of all and been subjected to the worst forms of discrimination. B.R. Ambedkar described this system of social stratification as being “an ascending scale of reverence and a descending scale of contempt.”.

Over time, this division transformed into a far more complex system consisting of thousands of graded, endogamous groups. The ideology underlying this division, which could be called ‘Brahmanism’, was perpetuated, enforced and reinforced in society through violence and coercion by the most powerful castes, with the ideological support of Hindu religious scriptures which never fail to emphasise the importance of maintaining caste order and following one’s (caste) ‘dharma’. (Riddles of Hinduism, Debrahmanising History) This religious discourse formed the ideological basis for a society in which the lower castes were kept in slavery-like bondage and assigned varying levels of “pollutedness”, which was seen as justification for the brutal forms of discrimination and oppression they were subjected to.

These caste groups eventually evolved into "watertight compartments” (Ambedkar) of occupation-based communities. So much so, that in India the words commonly used by many people to refer to professionals such as goldsmiths (called Sonar in Hindi, for example), barbers (Nai), grocers (Bania), washermen (Dhobi), carpenters (Badhai), gardeners (Mali), shoemakers (Mochi),  etc. are actually names of individual castes whose members have been engaged in those professions for countless generations.

As a result of the imposition of this system, the vast majority of people falling within the caste order have lacked any kind of social or economic mobility for a period of close to two thousand years. Caste has become so ingrained in the Indian psyche that caste-divisions have continued to persist, albeit in a weakened form, even when large sections of people have adopted new religions such as Islam and Christianity.

### Caste in Transition

There have, of course, been many transformations in the traditional system over the course of history. Many profound changes have occurred in recent times, which have challenged the hegemony of the upper-castes.

Constitutionally mandated reservations in educational and administrative public institutions, which were brought into force at after independence, have allowed a small but significant section of Scheduled Castes (SC, a constitutional term roughly equivalent to the category of Dalit), Scheduled Tribes (ST, official term for India’s indigenous people, also known as Adivasis) and more recently, the Other Backward Classes (OBC, official term roughly equivalent to the category of Shudra) to acquire higher education and high and medium level government jobs, which has created a new dalit-bahujan middle class.

The political mobilisation of the lower castes which began in the colonial period has only gained strength in independent India. Dalit-bahujan political parties have found remarkable success in many parts of the country, and have successfully challenged upper-caste hegemony. Political reservations, as well as the large population of lower-castes, ensure that no political party can afford to completely disregard their interests.

The introduction of modern economic regulations and policies in the British period, carried forward by the government in independent India have brought about structural changes in the Indian economy, which have to an extent diluted the monopoly of a very small set of castes on trade and business. The opening up of the Indian economy to the international market in the mid 1980s has accelerated this process.

Industrialisation, urbanisation and technological progress have produced new kinds of jobs and modified existing ones. These have created opportunities for urban migration, which has allowed many lower-caste people to escape the oppressive social order of their villages and move to towns and cities, where they are able to live with relatively greater dignity and freedom.

In spite of these changes, economic data from India suggests that the underlying patterns of educational achievement, employment, land and asset ownership and standards of living in Indian society continue to be determined by caste. It is a well established fact that the opportunities afforded to an individual for educational, economic and political advancement in Indian society still depend to a very large extent on the caste into which they are born. (Thorat)

### The Economic Consequences of Caste

The caste system obviously has far-reaching economic consequences. In the words of Ambedkar:

>“Caste System is not merely division of labour. It is also a division of labourers…[it] is an hierarchy in which the divisions of labourers are graded one above the other...As an economic organization caste is... a harmful institution, inasmuch as, it involves the subordination of man's natural powers and inclinations to the exigencies of social rules.”

Caste undermines any possibility of achieving efficiency and optimality in economic processes as it disrupts the forces which push an economic system in such a direction. Its imposition of occupation based on birth restricts access to different modes of living and means of livelihood, often forcing people into jobs they have no inclination for, or compelling them to stay unemployed rather than take up occupations not compatible with their caste. (Ambedkar)

Caste also divides people into antagonistic groups, foreclosing the possibility of solidarity across the lines of class or gender. It is, therefore, believed by many to be largely responsible for the startling levels of poverty and deprivation in India, which are completely out of proportion to the economic resources and capacity of the Indian state.

## A Brief Overview of the Indian Retail Economy

### India’s Retail Economy

Retail is defined as the sale of goods and services directly to consumers. Retail trade may be contrasted with wholesale trade, which is the sale of goods in bulk for retail or other commercial purposes. Important retail categories include food and beverages, clothing, healthcare, jewellery, electronics and electrical appliances, and personal care products.

In India, the retail market is one of the biggest sectors of the economy in terms of its economic value, and generates about 10% of India’s gross domestic product and 8% of the employment. There are estimated to be 12 to 15 million retail outlets in India, and only 4% of them are larger than 500 square feet in size. About 92% of all retailing in India happens in the unorganised sector, through unregistered small shops and vendors. (KPMG)

The most common retail outlet for the purchase of daily groceries in India is still the small owner-manned kirana shop, though in recent times, large convenience and grocery store chains have also started to emerge as popular outlets among the more affluent residents of bigger cities.

India’s retail sector thus largely remains outside the bounds of the regulatory powers of the state. Though the proliferation of industrially produced consumer goods in the last few decades has helped the retail industry expand and reach new segments of the Indian population, its functioning is still governed more by traditional social and economic norms than modern economic policy.

In recent years, the Indian government has allowed foreign direct investment of upto 51% in single and multi-brand retail stores in India. This has the potential to drastically alter the current face of Indian retail in the years to come.

### Caste and Trade in India

Trade in India, including retailing, has always been associated with a few specific castes. This association is obviously rooted in the caste system which designates the tasks of business, trade and money-lending to castes lying in the Vaishya varna. On the other hand, historically, the lower castes have been assigned the role of the labouring classes and have had no right to own property. Thus, though the lower castes have always formed the backbone of the economy as the producers of commodities, due to the unsurmountable barriers created by caste-divisions, distribution and wealth accumulation have been the preserve of the upper-castes.

Anyone who has shopped in an Indian bazaar would know that the traditional trading castes continue to dominate the market even in the 21st century. Baniyas, Jains, Sindhis, Khatris, and other castes which have been traditionally associated with the occupation of trade, can be found manning most kirana, clothing, jewellery and sweet shops in most parts of the country. Additionally, caste-based business associations, formed to protect the economic interests of certain castes or groups of castes, have tremendous influence and often play a crucial role in determining the terms of trade and employment. (Harriss-White) Many traditional traders, true to their caste dharma, also indulge in small-scale money-lending.

Chandra Bhan Prasad and Milind Kamble, in an article written in support of foreign direct investment in the retail sector, state:

>“Amongst segments of the Indian economy, trading is still regulated by tradition. Retail in particular is deeply rooted in antiquity. Not surprisingly, traders also double as moneylenders. This parallel banking system that traditional traders practise hurts the economy, discourages new players, and most often, blocks the circulation of currency.”

(http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/To-empower-dalits-do-away-with-Indias-antiquated-retail-trading-system/articleshow/17482382.cms)

Not surprisingly, in India’s present day capitalist class - which has grown from strength to strength since the advent of neoliberalism - the richest and most powerful groups are invariably from the mercantile castes. For example, the 10 richest people in India, according to Forbes magazine are: Lakshmi Mittal (Baniya), Mukesh Ambani (Baniya), Azim Premji (Lohana), Ruia brothers (Baniya), Savitri Jindal (Baniya), Gautam Adani (Baniya), K.M. Birla (Baniya), Anil Ambani (Baniya), Sunil Mittal (Baniya), Adi Godrej (Parsi). (Aakar Patel, http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/why-caste-persists-in-politics/article2940080.ece).

About 75% of all people appointed to the post of president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the largest and oldest apex business organisation in India, since it was founded in 1927, belong to mercantile castes, while over 85% are upper-caste Hindus. (http://ficci.in/about-Past-President.asp)

The persistence of casteist attitudes and relationships bolsters the authority and political clout of these groups. On the other hand, Dalits, Adivasis and most OBC castes lack the inherited wealth and property, as well as the influential caste networks of the upper-castes. (Harriss-White)

## Purpose of this Study

This study aims to shed light on the role played by caste in the functioning of India’s retail economy. It looks at some historical and sociological dimensions of the evolution and structure of India’s markets and demonstrates how the caste system remains a pervasive force in the Indian retail sector. It also considers the role affirmative action can play in the creation of a more equitable and diverse retail market, by looking at the effects of such policies in other countries

## Literature Review

Many historians and economists have documented the past and present of India’s trade economy, however hardly of them any have paid sufficient attention to how the caste system has played a defining role in the evolution of Indian markets. On the few occasions when a specific trading caste has been studied, there has been a tendency to glorify the “entrepreneurial spirit” of the caste (Timberg) without properly interrogating how the exclusionary forces of the caste system have helped propel certain caste groups to success in business at the expense of others. Nonetheless, many of these studies, if engaged with critically, provide insight into the evolution and functioning of the trade economy.

Harish Damodaran’s book ‘India’s New Capitalists’ traces the history of India’s trading castes, along with the trajectories of the newly emerging entrepreneurial communities, from the colonial period to the present day. Due to its focus on the histories of specific caste groups, it often brings to light the vital role caste-capital plays in ensuring success in business, and is an important source of information for this project.

Barbara Harriss-White et al in their book ‘Dalits and Adivasis in India’s Business Economy’ present an extensive analysis of the disproportionately low participation rates of these two groups in different spheres of the Indian economy over the last three decades, using data from the economic censuses. They also investigate the factors which prevent dalits and adivasis from undertaking private enterprise.

The well-known economist, journalist and intellectual Chandra Bhan Prasad has done extensive research on the effects of neoliberalism on India’s lower castes, and his two research papers: ‘Markets and Manu: Economic Reforms and its Impact on Caste in India’ and ‘Rethinking Inequality: Dalits in Uttar Pradesh in the Market Reform Era’ present many new insights into how Indian social relationships are being altered in the face of rapid economic change.

The collection of research articles on caste discrimination, ‘Blocked by Caste: Economic Discrimination in Modern India’ edited by Sukhdeo Thorat and Katherine S. Newman provides an authoritative and quantitatively rigorous account of exclusion in various sectors and aspects of India’s economy. Through painstaking empirical work it demonstrates the startling levels of discrimination faced by lower castes and minorities in both market and non-market institutions.

The historical evolution of the Indian trade economy can be better understood with the help of C.A. Bayly’s acclaimed book ‘Rulers, Townsmen and Bazaars’, which gives a detailed account of economic changes with occurred in the period between 1770 and 1870 in North India. This period marks the downfall of the Mughal empire and the beginning of  British rule and was a period of great political and economic upheaval. The book looks at how this period of transition affected trade and trading communities in the cities, towns and qasbahs of the gangetic plains, and is particularly insightful because it often provides a caste-based perspective.

Claude Markovits in his book ‘Merchants, Traders and Entrepreneurs: Indian Business in the Colonial Era’, which is a collection of essays, provides important insights into the evolution of Indian business and entrepreneurship in the British era. He presents a history of the rise of pan-Indian merchant networks, the rise of nationalism among the Indian business class and the close symbiotic relationship it shared with the Indian National Congress.

## Research Design

In the first part of this study I will present a historical account of the evolution of Indian trade through the ages, with a focus on how this evolution was driven by the exclusionary and exploitative ideology of caste. In the second part I will analyse the present structure and functioning of the Indian retail market based on economic data from secondary sources such as the Economic Census and the National Sample Survey, as well as earlier studies in this area. Finally, I will present and analyse primary data collected through sample surveys from two small town bazaars, both located in very different social, economic and demographic contexts, to reach some conclusions about the caste composition of retail markets in India.

The fieldwork for this study has been carried out in Karanjia block of Dindori district in Madhya Pradesh, and in the city of Wardha, Maharashtra. Karanjia is a rural, predominantly adivasi area located on the Eastern border of Madhya Pradesh.  It has a population of 86,802 of which 74.3% belong to the ST category and 3.2% to the SC category. The most populous adivasi groups in this region are Gond and Baiga. Wardha is a small town in eastern Maharashtra which is also the headquarters of Wardha district. It has a population of 1,06,444, of which 15.4% belong to the SC category and 5.5% to the ST category. (2011 Census)

The fieldwork involved conducting sample surveys of shopkeepers in retail markets at these two locations, with the primary objective of determining the caste composition of the bigger and wealthier retailers in these markets. The shops chosen were permanent medium and large-sized retail establishments selling products such as groceries, jewellery, clothing, medicine, electronics, utensils, furniture and cosmetics. Given the nature of the survey and the paucity of time, carrying out systematic random sampling was difficult, and so the subjects were chosen arbitrarily during a stroll through the market, with an effort to pick participants as randomly as possible. The sample size for the Karanjia markets was 69 shopkeepers, while in Wardha 50 shopkeepers were surveyed.

## Hypothesis

My hypotheses regarding the caste composition of a typical Indian bazaar are:

* Most of the bigger retail establishments are owned by members of caste groups whose traditional occupation is trade.

* Even though the caste composition of the trade economy is undergoing change, lower caste groups, especially dalits and adivasis have very low participation rates in private retail enterprise.

* The Indian retail economy continues to be regulated to a large extent by the rules of caste, with every caste having a designated place and role.
